  <br><h2 id="d"> 1.LCD Scrolling display using 8051 microcontroller</h2>
     <br> The core objective is to program the microcontroller to output a message that scrolls across the screen,
      either horizontally or vertically. This project is a fundamental exercise in embedded systems,
       teaching students how to interface a microcontroller with a peripheral device and manage its operation 
       through software. 
       <h2 id="d"> 2.IOT And ML for smart energy management with dynamic load variations </h2> 
       <br>This project focuses on building a smart energy management system that leverages the power of Internet
        of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) to address the challenge of dynamic load variations. 
        The primary goal is to optimize energy consumption, reduce costs, and enhance grid stability by 
        intelligently predicting and managing energy demand in real-time. This system is crucial for applications
         ranging from smart homes and buildings to large industrial facilities.
